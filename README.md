# CCF

**Hey!**
This is CCF or 'Circle Central Formula'. It is mathematical formula exercised through [Python](https://www.python.org/) and embeded using the [Pyscript](https://pyscript.net/) module.

CCF is Defined as the formula for obtaining the co-ordinates of the centre of the circle if 3 points which pass through the circle are provided. **_However_** the program may give slightly different answers due to rounding error.

In itself CCF is indenpendently dervived by [me](https://github.com/Khalid-Azmatullah) using 10th grade mathematics and a little logic.
The pure python code is on [Replit](https://replit.com/@khalidstudymate/CCF) and is extremely basic in nature.

Further more, this is my second html project through which I learned the use of [Pyscript](https://pyscript.net/) and CSS.
